## How It Works
Our program works by prompting the user to enter in their name and age. It will then return a sentence incorporating the user input information. The sentence will follow the following structure: "Your name is ___ and your age is ___ ."

## How To Use It
The program can be run using a python compiler. Following compilation, the program will ask for the inputs and return the previously mentioned sentence altered by the given information. 

## How To Contribute To It
The program can be contributed to if you want to ask the user for any other information regarding themselves. This can then be added on into the returned string and display the information back to the user.
